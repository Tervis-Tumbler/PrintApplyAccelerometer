# PrintApply Accelerometer

This project records data from an ADXL345 accelerometer as JSON-encoded text files. These can be parsed using the included Logstash configuration file, or with some data manipulation, using Plot.ly's cloud graphing/charting service. Please read the Wiki for more information.

The schematic was created using ExpressSCH.
